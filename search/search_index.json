Preferably abbreviate the month if it's a full date: Sept. 4, 2024. Usually spell it out if not a full date: September 4. I make exceptions for this when I put dates in headlines, to keep headlines at a manageable length. If the date for something is in the same year you\u2019re in (say, 2024), you don\u2019t need to list the year. Times It is not 12 pm. It is Noon or noon. AP style says we should be doing it like this: 9 a.m. ET. But it seems that the standard here is 9 am ET\u2014no periods\u2014so just keep doing that. You don\u2019t need to put zeros after a time, so use: 9 am ET instead of 9:00 am ET. On that note, be sure to note the time zone in everything. I\u2019d prefer just to make it ET in all references. Headlines Much to my chagrin, Strat Comm wants headlines in sentence case. So a headline would be: \u201cNick disagrees with Strat Comm team\u201d not \u201cNick Disagrees with Strat Comm Team.\u201d Exception: Events for the calendar. Title case is fine for those, as they are the proper noun names of the events. Note: If you\u2019re posting a blog on the website for MD Student News and it is a phase-specific item, go ahead and put that in the headline so they know it\u2019s an item for their attention: \u201cPhase 3: Select Transitions 3 track today\u201d Call to Action We get a lot of submissions that have no calls to action: \u201cPhase 2 scheduling guidelines.\u201d It doesn\u2019t tell the reader what to do with it. It doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal, but it really helps to make that explicit: \u201cClass of 2027: Read more about upcoming Phase 2 scheduling guidelines.\u201d There are some helpful lists online that you can print out that offer lots of call-to-action verbs. Titles As you know, we put the person\u2019s academic credentials after their name on first reference: Nick McLain, MD, PhD.
