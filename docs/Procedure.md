# Procedure

## I. MD Student News Procedure

Send every Monday at 5:30 PM ET. We send out six separate versions of the email:

- One for stakeholders
- One each for the four student phases (P1Y1, P1Y2, P2, P3)
- One for LOAs (students on leave of absence)

**Stakeholders Version (1)**
**Very important:** Stakeholders are allowed to unsubscribe from the newsletter, so you’ll need to change it to the **commercial template**.

- `Data Extensions > IN-MED > MD Student News & Events > Admin > Core MSE Stakeholders`
- `Data Extensions > IN-MED > MD Student News & Events > Admin > Faculty and Staff Subscribe Form-Students Newsletter`
- When it asks for a publication list, put in **MD Student News Stakeholders**.

**Phase-Specific Versions (4)**
**Very important:** We don’t want students to unsubscribe, so these emails should use the **transactional template**.

- **Phase 1 Year 1:**  
  `Data Extensions > IN-MED > MD Student News & Events > P1Y1_Class of 2028_0824`
- **Phase 1 Year 2:**  
  `Data Extensions > IN-MED > MD Student News & Events > P1Y2_Class of 2027_0824`
- **Phase 2:**  
  `Data Extensions > IN-MED > MD Student News & Events > P2_Class of 2026_0824`
- **Phase 3:**  
  `Data Extensions > IN-MED > MD Student News & Events > P3_Class of 2025_0824`

When it asks for a publication list, put in **MD Student News Students**.

**LOA Version (1)**
LOAs are a special case and will need their own version of the email, which will be the **stakeholder version** with all phase info included. However, we don’t want the students to unsubscribe, so use the **transactional template**.

- `Data Extensions > IN-MED > MD Student News & Events > LOAs_0824`

When it asks for a publication list, put in **MD Student News Students**.

## II. Student Events Email Procedure

Send every Tuesday at 3:00 PM ET.

**Exceptions:**  
This email is not sent during the days from around Christmas through New Year.  
It is also paused in June and July due to a lack of entries.

This email will use the **commercial template** with the publication list **Student Events**.
