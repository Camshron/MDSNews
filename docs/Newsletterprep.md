## Weekly Newsletter

Send every Monday at 5:30 PM ET. We send out six separate versions of the email:

### 1. Stakeholders Version (One email)
    
- **Very important:** Stakeholders are allowed to unsubscribe from the newsletter, so you’ll need to change it to the **commercial template**.

- `Data Extensions > IN-MED > MD Student News & Events > Admin > Core MSE Stakeholders`
- `Data Extensions > IN-MED > MD Student News & Events > Admin > Faculty and Staff Subscribe Form-Students Newsletter`
- When it asks for a publication list, put in **MD Student News Stakeholders**.

### 2. Phase-Specific Versions (Four Emails)

- **Very important:** We don’t want students to unsubscribe, so these emails should use the **transactional template**.

  - **Phase 1 Year 1:**  
      `Data Extensions > IN-MED > MD Student News & Events > P1Y1_Class of 2028_0824`

  - **Phase 1 Year 2:**  
      `Data Extensions > IN-MED > MD Student News & Events > P1Y2_Class of 2027_0824`

  - **Phase 2:**  
      `Data Extensions > IN-MED > MD Student News & Events > P2_Class of 2026_0824`

  - **Phase 3:**  
      `Data Extensions > IN-MED > MD Student News & Events > P3_Class of 2025_0824`

  - Publication list: **MD Student Events**
  

### 3. LOA Version (One Email)

- LOAs are a special case and will need their own version of the email, which will be the **stakeholder version** with all phase info included. However, we don’t want the students to unsubscribe, so use the **transactional template**.

  - `Data Extensions > IN-MED > MD Student News & Events > LOAs_0824`

  - When it asks for a publication list, put in **MD Student News Students**.
