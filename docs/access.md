Go to https://salesforce.ucm.iu.edu 

Scroll down to “Getting access to Marketing Cloud.” 

Scroll down and click on “Submit an access request form.” 

Click on “User access request form” button. 

In username, just put your IU username. 

Request type is ‘Request Access.” 

Under “Include Communication Module Access (Marketing Cloud)”, click Yes. 

In “Requested IU Units,” enter our member ID: 7325516. That is our number for IN-MED-MSE in Salesforce Marketing Cloud. 

In User Type, select “Communications User Only.” 

Do not select any of the boxes in Requested Data Populations. 

Click on each of the Agreements and Tutorials and complete them/sign off on them. 

Once that is down, click drop down menu and select “I have completed all required compliance tutorials and agreements.” 

Select Submit button at bottom of screen. 

You will likely receive a request from IU’s CRM team to do some trainings before granting you access. Go ahead and complete those trainings. If you have any questions about them, you can ask Nick and/or Joel.
