# **Branding & Guidelines**

[See the editorial style guide for more information](https://medicine.iu.edu/style-guide)       

### **Dates**

- It is Sept. 4 or September 4, not September 4th or Sept. 4th.
</br>
- Preferably abbreviate the month if it's a full date: Sept. 4, 2024.
</br>
- Usually spell it out if not a full date: September 4.
</br>
- I make exceptions for this when I put dates in headlines, to keep headlines at a manageable length.
</br>
- If the date for something is in the same year you’re in (say, 2024), you don’t need to list the year.

### **Times**

- It is not 12 pm. It is Noon or noon.
</br>
- AP style says we should be doing it like this: 9 a.m. ET. But it seems that the standard here is 9 am ET—no periods—so just keep doing that.
</br>
- You don’t need to put zeros after a time, so use: 9 am ET instead of 9:00 am ET.
</br>
- On that note, be sure to note the time zone in everything. I’d prefer just to make it ET in all references.

### **Headlines**

- Much to my chagrin, Strat Comm wants headlines in sentence case. So a headline would be:
</br>
- “Nick disagrees with Strat Comm team” not “Nick Disagrees with Strat Comm Team.”

**Exception:** Events for the calendar. Title case is fine for those, as they are the proper noun names of the events.

**Note:** If you’re posting a blog on the website for MD Student News and it is a phase-specific item, go ahead and put that in the headline so they know it’s an item for their attention:  
“Phase 3: Select Transitions 3 track today”

### **Call to Action**

- We get a lot of submissions that have no calls to action:  
“Phase 2 scheduling guidelines.” It doesn’t tell the reader what to do with it.
</br>
- It doesn’t seem like a big deal, but it really helps to make that explicit:  
“Class of 2027: Read more about upcoming Phase 2 scheduling guidelines.”

There are some helpful lists online that you can print out that offer lots of call-to-action verbs.

### **Titles**

- As you know, we put the person’s academic credentials after their name on first reference:  
Nick McLain, MD, PhD.
</br>
- On second reference (and third, fourth, etc.), just use their last name—even if they’re a doctor. Don’t put “Dr. McLain wrote this…” – just say “McLain wrote this…”

When using someone’s job title:

- Capitalize it when used **before** their name  
  *Example: Communications Specialist Nick McLain*
</br>
- Do **not** capitalize it when used **after** their name  
  *Example: Nick McLain, communications specialist, said that…*
